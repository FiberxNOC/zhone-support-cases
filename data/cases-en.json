Example:\n> linkagg arm 0 disable\nOr, alternatively:\n\n* Perform a local test by connecting a laptop to an uplink port with an SFP electrical connection (e.g., port 1-1-4-0/eth) and configuring a bridge untagged on this port with the problematic VLAN. Then, test connectivity from that point to isolate the issue.\n\nNote: Replace 'exemplo' with 'example'."

    "notas": "Cordial saludo team,\n\nWe appreciate Omar Gonzalez, who helped us last time under the ticket number 108574, if possible to assist in a remote session to analyze the possible cause of this failure which is the same. We detected packet losses ranging from 15% when performing an extended ping from our HPE switch (where the uplink connects via LINKAGG) towards the IP address of the OLT.\n\nOur HPE switch has the IP address 100.84.222.253, and the OLT has the IP address 100.84.222.254.\n\nThis intermittent failure is affecting two customers provisioned on the OLT:\n\n-fx-224993-jpicacaprilosprados 1/1/8\n-fx-230147-jardinelpatioinc 1/3/2\n\nFrom our side, we verified the physical link between OLT and OK node, i.e., there are no errors or drops in the two ports that form the LINKAGG. Additionally, the optical signal is observed to be okay, nor are there flaps or packet losses in the ports. Furthermore, we also restarted the equipment and observed that the connection stabilized for 20 minutes but then started having packet losses again.\n\nWe have attached a traffic capture made on the uplink ports of the OLT if it is useful.\nWe have also attached evidence of monitoring services affected that led us to these customers where you can see packet losses in their connections.\n\nAttached in diagnostic_commands.txt is the result of executing the commands:\n\n-showfataldata\n-dshell\n> showExceptionData\n- gpononuponstat showall and\n-log cache\n-alarm show\n-onu status x/y\n-shelfctrl monitor\n\n*****************************************************************\n-PING DESDE OLT HACIA SU GATEWAY (NODO HPE )\n\nfx.oldz.caguas.f108# ping -c 10 100.84.222.253\nPING 100.84.222.253: 64 data bytes\n!!.!.!!!!!\n----100.84.222.253 PING Statistics----\n10 packets transmitted, 8 packets received, 20% packet loss\nround-trip (ms) min/avg/max = 0/4/10\nfx.oldz.caguas.f108# ping -c 100 100.84.222.253\nPING 100.84.222.253: 64 data bytes\n..!!!!!!!!!!.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.!!!!!!!!!..!!.!!.!!!!!!!!!!!.!.!.!.!!!!!!.!!!!!!!!.!.!!!!!!!!!\n----100.84.222.253 PING Statistics----\n100 packets transmitted, 85 packets received, 15% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0/5/70\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n-PING DESDE NODO HACIA OLT\n\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=81 ttl=64 time=1.718 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=82 ttl=64 time=2.056 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=83 ttl=64 time=1.592 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=84 ttl=64 time=1.643 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=85 ttl=64 time=1.582 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=86 ttl=64 time=1.613 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=87 ttl=64 time=8.902 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=88 ttl=64 time=1.689 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=89 ttl=64 time=1.812 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=90 ttl=64 time=1.655 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=91 ttl=64 time=1.626 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=92 ttl=64 time=1.671 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=93 ttl=64 time=1.667 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=94 ttl=64 time=1.638 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=95 ttl=64 time=1.685 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=96 ttl=64 time=1.660 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=97 ttl=64 time=64.111 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=98 ttl=64 time=1.770 ms\n56 bytes from 100.84.222.254: icmp_seq=99 ttl=64 time=1.672 ms\n\n--- Ping statistics for 100.84.222.254 ---\n100 packet(s) transmitted, 85 packet(s) received, 15.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 1.542/3.530/64.111/7.963 ms\n<fx.aghp.cag.smartnet>*\nEnvironment\n\nZhone mx1U108 software version MX 2.5.4.500\ndebugfallas\ndebugfallas slots 1\nType : MXK 108\nSub-Type : MXK 108 -

    "notas": "Currently, problems persist with OLTs designed to function as routers, specifically models 2466GN and HX-5228XG, even when configured in bridge mode.\n\nIn these scenarios, BGP and OSPF sessions experience constant drops. The situation was stabilized only by replacing the aforementioned ONUs with model 5302, which does not exhibit the described issues.",
    "detalleDelProblema": "- Issues are identified when attempting to pass traffic OSPF on ONUs model HX-5228XG with firmware version S7.0.025, operating in bridge mode.\n\n- The OSPF session is unable to establish itself correctly. \n- All tests were performed on our laboratory OLT, where the behavior was consistent and reproducible.",
    "resolucion": "The manufacturer supplied the firmware version hx5228xgsip_0700093, which is supposed to address the reported issue.\n\nNevertheless, even updating the available firmware on the ONU HX-5228XG, the problem persists.\n\nDuring a remote session, the OSPF session was temporarily lifted by disabling DNS Proxy functionality on the ONU and applying the \"vp mcast s-vid 2323\" configuration to the PON port of the OLT."
